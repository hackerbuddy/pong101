##Practicing with the HTML5 Canvas and Javascript pong
--updated 10/2/17

Hello everyone, this game originally followed a tutorial by Mozilla, but has since then departed from the mold, by adding buttons and functionality and allowing you to kill the AI.

This game is hosted at bradenrucinski.com/pongsux. My up-to-date source code is running at that site, with cleaner, more professional language.

If you want to learn to make games in the HTML Canvas, you can get started below!
