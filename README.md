## Practicing with the HTML5 Canvas and Javascript pong
--updated 10/2/17--index.html is latest file, oldindex.html is old file

Hello everyone, this game originally followed a tutorial by Mozilla, but has since then departed from the mold, by adding buttons and functionality and allowing you to kill the AI.

This game is hosted at [bradenrucinski.com/pongsux/index.html](http://bradenrucinski.com/pongsux/index.html). My up-to-date source code is running at that site, with cleaner, more professional language. 

If you want to learn to make games in the HTML Canvas, you can get started below!

There are some very noticable bugs at the moment, the game breaks after you kill the AI. I will later implement this. Also, the text instructions don't reset-- you'll have to reload in your browser. This is actually easy to do but I haven't got around to it yet.

For you brave learners, click on the Mozilla tutorial below to learn to build a game in your browser!
